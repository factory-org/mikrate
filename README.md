ðŸš§ This is still very much work in progress so don't expect all APIs to be stable ðŸš§

miKrate aims at providing an easy, typesafe, pluggable DSL and API to allow you to quickly develop migrations, apply
them automatically and all of that database agnostic (dialects are pluggable).

## Sample

The sample creates a table with

```kotlin
val sampleMigration by migration {
    up {
        createTable("SampleTable") {
            column("id", IntegerType) {
                primary()
            }
            column("string", VarcharType(32))
        }
    }
}


val exec = JDBCExecutor("jdbc:sqlite:sample.db")
val mig = Migrator(exec, SqliteAutoDialect, SqliteCoreDialect)

mig.migrateTo(sampleMigration)
```

## Components

### [Core](./core)

Contains the core classes and other glue to hold most things together.

### [DSL](./dsl)

Provides a DSL for creating migrations.

### [Auto-Migrate](./auto-migrate)

Provides functions to automatically apply the migrations to a database.

### [Executors](./executors)

Provides various executors for various standards of connecting to the database.
See [here](./executors/README.md#supported-executors) for a list of executors supported.

### [Dialects](./dialects)

Provides dialects for various databases. See [here](./dialects/README.md#supported-dialects) for a list of dialects
supported.

## Supported Platform

Currently, only the JVM platform is supported, but in general it should be possible to convert it into a multiplatform
project.

## WIP

- Documentation
- Better locking
- Validation
- Auto-generated migrations (with pluggable ORMs, an API safe code generation (via library) and gradle plugin)
