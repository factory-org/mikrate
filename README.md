## Databases

Legend:

- âœ… = Full
- â†— = External / 3rd party
- ðŸš§ = Partial support
- â­• = Not (yet) supported
- â›” = Intentionally unsupported

| DBMS       | Core Support | Auto Migrate | Full JDBC Support | Full R2DBC Support | Comments |
| ---------- | :----------: | :----------: | :---------------: | :----------------: | -------- |
| SQLite     | âœ…            | âœ…            | âœ…                 | â­•<br>No Driver     |          |
| PostgreSQL | âœ…            | âœ…            | âœ…                 | âœ…                  |          |

It is currently not possible to easily expand this to support other databases (e.g. via plugins), this is planned for
the future.

## Supported Platform

Currently, only the JVM platform is supported, but in general it should be possible to convert it into a multiplatform
project.
